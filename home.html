                My name is Jose Guzman-Vargas. 
                With over three years at BECU I have built a strong foundation in financial operations and services. 
                I hold an associate degree and currently pursuing a bachelor’s in Computer Science. 
                I have applied my technical knowledge to make projects using Python, Flask, and SQLite. 
                My skills in SQL and Excel along with certifications in Google Data Analytics and Linux Essentials, position me well for roles that bridge technology and business.
                I have communicated and collaborated with multiple departments to handle large volumes of transactions, secured confidential member information while complying with all banking regulations, and effectively managed strict deadlines to deliver to key stakeholders.
